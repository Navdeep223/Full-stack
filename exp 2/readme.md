# Web Development Experiments

This repository contains three interactive front-end experiments developed using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SVG**.  
Each experiment demonstrates practical usage of JavaScript event handling, DOM manipulation, and responsive design.

## Experiment 1: Live Character Count

### Aim
To design a web application that displays a **live character count** as the user types into a text field.

### Objectives
- Capture keyboard input events
- Count characters dynamically
- Update the count in real time
- Improve user input awareness

### Description
This experiment uses JavaScript event listeners to monitor user input in a textarea.  
As the user types or deletes characters, the character count is updated instantly and displayed on the screen.

### Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Output
The character count increases or decreases live based on user input.

## 🛒 Experiment 2: Product Filter

### Aim
To create a **product filtering system** based on user-selected categories or search input.

### Objectives
- Display a list of products
- Filter products dynamically using JavaScript
- Improve user experience with instant filtering
- Use DOM manipulation effectively

### Description
This experiment displays a set of products.  
Users can filter products based on category or name using buttons or a search bar.  
The filtering happens without page reload, making it fast and interactive.

### Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Output
Only the products matching the selected filter criteria are displayed.

## Experiment 3: SVG Drawing Tool

### Aim
To build an **interactive SVG drawing tool** using mouse event handlers.

### Objectives
- Create an SVG canvas
- Track mouse events for drawing
- Draw shapes dynamically (circles)
- Implement undo functionality
- Add color selection
- Make the canvas responsive

### Description
This experiment allows users to draw circles on an SVG canvas using mouse movements.  
Each circle is created dynamically with JavaScript.  
Users can change colors, undo the last drawing action, and view the total number of shapes drawn.

### Hardware / Software Requirements
**Hardware**
- Intel i5 processor or above
- 8 GB RAM

**Software**
- Chrome or Firefox browser
- Any text editor (VS Code recommended)

### Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- SVG

### Output
Users can draw multiple colored circles on the SVG canvas with undo support.
